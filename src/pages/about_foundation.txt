The John D. Chang Foundation was established to honor John's memory by supporting the two passions of his life: sports and broadcast journalism.

The Foundation is guided by the values that were central to John's life and include a spirit of caring, a commitment to excellence, compassion and love. To further those values, the Foundation will provide scholarships to students pursuing a career in broadcasting and support youth sports teams and community events.

The Foundation seeks to enhance the quality of life within the community by promoting harmony, respect for diversity, responsibility and academic achievement. By supporting the vision of John D. Chang, each of us really can make a difference.
